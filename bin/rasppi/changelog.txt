Version 0.94 (25/08/2017)
-Fixed bugs related to updating channel's last active date
-Fixed counting channel's rank for channels with only 1 occurence (e.g. temporary)

============================================================

Version 0.93 (02/02/2017):
NOT COMPATIBLE WITH EARLIER SETTINGS FILE (although a missing line can be added to the end of the file - the setting: ignore-temp= with value 0 or 1 (false/true) )

-Added ignoring temporary channels when gathering snapshots (temp channels from earlier snapshots will not be removed and will still be considered)
-Added automatisation for the compressor for usage straight from the command line (e.g. 
"./tsam -a print -save -inc -avg >> programlog.txt" will create a compressed file, sort it increasingly according to their average client number, save the result to file and exit, at the same time saving all the program output in programlog.txt) - see github page -> manual.md or run ./tsam with parameters: -a help
-Reworked channel rank to consider the span of all the snapshot files, not just the snapshots that include the channel
-Fixed average number not updating
-Fixed not all snapshot files being read by compressor

============================================================

Version 0.92 (29/01/2017):
NOT COMPATIBLE WITH 0.9/0.91 SNAPSHOTS/SETTINGS FILE(S)!
-Added saving compressor's sorted/view results to file
-Added sorting to the compressor's interface
-Added parent ID to recorded data
-Channel rank now based on peak hours and activity on sub-channels (and their sub-channels etc.)
-Added generating snapshots only during specified hours
-Addded testing connection and login details on startup

============================================================

Version 0.91 (28/01/2017):
-Increased the number of digits after decimal point for 'average' and' channel rank'
-Fixed compressor failing to load files due to wrong pathnames
-Fixed incorrect compressor message regarding snapshot files
-Fixed a bug, where the last few channels get duplicated in the records
